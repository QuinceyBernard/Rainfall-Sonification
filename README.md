# Rainfall Sonification

A piece of artwork that was created as part of the Creating with Data module, wherein data is sonified through the use of P5.JS allowing for a different interpretaion of the data through audio as opposed to just visually. Each of the notes varies depending on the data, so if there was greater rainfall in a specific season the note will take longer to decay and fade out, whilst if there was less rainfall the note decays a lot quicker. The dataset used is of the total rainfall in each season within a specified time period for the area of the South West of England.

## Installation

Use a local host service such as MAMP to be able to run the code on your own computer/laptop. 

There have been reported issues with this piece and Google Chrome due to the audio restrictions put in place with this browser, so using Firefox is suggested to ensure minimal issues when loading the artwork.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this piece was resourced from the MET Office website, which has various datasets detailing different weather data for various areas around the United Kingdom
